12. In XV6, a process can be in one of the following states:
UNUSED: The process is not in use.
EMBRYO: The process is being created.
SLEEPING: The process is waiting for an event to occur.
RUNNABLE: The process is ready to run but is waiting for the CPU.
RUNNING: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
ZOMBIE: The process has finished execution, but the parent has not yet collected its exit status.

13. File System Structure in XV6:
    Superblock: Metadata about file system, size, and key structural information.
    Inode Table: Stores metadata about files, permissions, and data block pointers.
    Data Blocks: Actual storage of file contents, referenced by inode pointers.
    Directory Entries: Associates filenames with corresponding inode numbers in directories.
    Bitmaps: Track allocation status of inodes and data blocks.
    
14. System Calls vs. Library Functions:
System Calls: These are functions provided by the operating system to interact with its services. Examples in XV6 include fork(), exec(), and exit().
Library Functions: These are higher-level functions provided by libraries and executed in user space. They often utilize system calls. Examples in XV6 include printf() from the C library.

15. Memory Paging in XV6:
XV6 uses a paging mechanism where the virtual memory is divided into fixed-size pages.
Paging allows for efficient use of physical memory and facilitates memory protection.
It provides a mapping between virtual addresses used by a program and physical addresses in RAM.

16. Shell Commands in XV6:
ls: Lists directory contents.
cd: Changes the current directory.
cp: Copies files or directories.

17. Process Synchronization in XV6:
Process synchronization is crucial for coordinating the execution of multiple processes.
Mechanisms such as locks and semaphores are used to control access to shared resources and prevent conflicts.

18. Interrupt Handling in XV6:
Interrupts in XV6 are handled by interrupt service routines (ISRs).
They are significant for responding to events like hardware interrupts and ensuring the proper functioning of the system.

19. Virtual Memory in XV6:
Virtual memory allows the execution of processes as if they have more physical memory than is actually available.
In XV6, this is achieved through demand paging, where pages are brought into memory only when needed.

20. Boot Process in XV6:
The boot process involves loading the boot loader, which then loads the XV6 kernel into memory.
The kernel initializes the system, sets up essential data structures, and transfers control to the main() function.
The system then begins executing user processes.
